# sidebar.md
In your `sidebar.md` file you can create links to documentation you wish to list
(just as you would in markdown). You have to list them in the form:


    - [Documentation 1](#docs/document_1)
    - [Documentation 2](#docs/document_2)
    - [Documentation 3](#docs/document_3)


**IMPORTANT NOTE**:
- Add `#` infront of `docs`, where `docs` is the folder where `document_1.md` resides
- Also ___DO NOT___ INCLUDE THE FILE EXTENSION AT THE END!
